Any organization or business dealing with subscriptions, classes and/or events could benefit from the use of OpenStudio.

OpenStudio will help you manage customers, subscriptions, class cards, schedule classes, plan events, calculate instructor payments, calculate & report revenue and more.

Online payments are provided through [Mollie](https://www.mollie.com/en). Please refer to their website & support for current rates and questions about availability in your region.
The OpenStudio Mollie integration handles single payments for classes, class cards, events and invoices. Recurring payments are supported for subscriptions. The web2py scheduler has to be running to process recurring payments.

## Exciting news!!

During the last few months a lot of work has been put into researching more modern technologies to use in OpenStudio. Slowly but surely OpenStudio is being rebuild using all modern technologies on a completely new technology stack. Although it'll be a good while before it's production ready and there's no ETA at this time, a solid foundation for future development has been implemented.
In case you have any great ideas for OpenStudio or would like to contribute some code, please join the discussion in the issues section on the project's GitHub page. The project is codenamed "Costasiella" for now, it might or might not change in the future.
